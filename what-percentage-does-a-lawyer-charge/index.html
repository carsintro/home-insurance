Whatever the amount is, your law firm will charge you on a contingency fee basis. In some states the percentage (or the maximum percentage) that a lawyer may charge by way of a contingency fee is set by law. While the maximum set amount that a lawyer may take does not usually exist in a dollar amount, it does generate various values through a set percentage. The percentage that a personal injury attorney charges is usually 30% to 40% of the total settlement amount.
