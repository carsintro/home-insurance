Accidental Texts To Parents That Are More Than Hilarious From qunki.com
The best time to send your accidental text on purpose, in my opinion, is at some point during the day or early in the evening. Hey [insert name] i know this isn’t an excuse for my behavior and i’m aware that i’m completely in the wrong. Avoid first thing in the morning because they’re likely to forget that. The accidental text on purpose is a nudge, it’s the technological equivalent of standing there waving your arms around, attempting to get to someone remember that you’re in existence.
