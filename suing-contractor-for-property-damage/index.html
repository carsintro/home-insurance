Property Managers Don’t get sued for trying to do the right thing with From constructionlawwatch.com
An insured may sue an insurance company if the company fails to follow the terms of the insurance company. A homeowner might be legally responsible when a contractor gets hurt while renovating or repairing the property. If damage is sustained to your property, first contact the contractor to raise the issue with them and ask how they would like to remedy the situation. A victim can hold you accountable and will be forced to pay if you damage someone’s belongings.
