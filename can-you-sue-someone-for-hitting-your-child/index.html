Whether you or someone you know was abused as a child, it’s important to know your legal options. I know brothers can be frustrating to deal with but you need to tell your parents what’s been going on and allow them to handle it. Failing to protect a child from great bodily harm when you know that another person has caused or intends to cause bodily harm to the child has a penalty of up to $25,000. If that person is under the age of 17, they will typically be charged as a juvenile, so different rules apply here.
