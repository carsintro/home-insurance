How much does a typical divorce cost? Strickler, Platnick &amp; Hatfield From modernfamilylawfirm.com
The cost of a contested divorce in florida typically ranges from $5,000 to $30,000. The average cost of a divorce is much less than a trial if you go to mediation, in which you and your spouse meet to resolve issues with a neutral third party. Very few charge $100 or less, and about 20% charge $400 or more. Lawyers are expensive because time is limited.
