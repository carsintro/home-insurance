To be “at fault” means that you, the driver, are responsible for the accident. We have been representing car accident victims for more than 20 years and we know what it takes to win cases. Even if you are partially at fault for the accident, you may be able to make a claim for damage. If you are at fault, the other driver may file a personal injury lawsuit after the accident.
