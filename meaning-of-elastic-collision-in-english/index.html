Catch the momentum meaning 744229Catch the momentum meaning From kabegaminju.blogspot.com
For example, two rubber balls bouncing together would be elastic. An elastic collision is one for which the momentum and most of the kinetic energy are conserved. A simple example of elastic collision is the striking of balls when striking. Elastic collision is the collision where kinetic energy is conserved.

<p>It is also known as a perfectly elastic collision. An elastic collision is an encounter between two bodies in which the total kinetic energy of the two bodies after the encounter is equal to their total kinetic energy before the encounter. A collision in which the sum of the kinetic energies of translation of the participating systems is the same after the collision as before.
